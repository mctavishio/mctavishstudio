<p>in the beginning</br>
there was a boat</br>

<p>shops glittering with red shiny</br>
electric lanterns</br>

<p>there were signs

<p>just this ...</br>
a dusty window pane &</br>
low rumble of</br>

<p>if there were gears</br>
slow gears to turn</br>
to turn back</br>

<p>we sent telegraph messages</br>

<p>"The abundance of the passenger pigeon shows, in the words of Audubon (1843) 'the astonishing bounty of the great Author of Nature in providing for the wants of his creatures.' 
</p>


<p>there were clouds of birds endless infinite skies of birds
</p>


<p>In the year 1914, at 12:45 p.m. on September the 1st at the Cincinnati Zoo, Martha, the last living passenger pigeon, fell from her perch and lay dead." 
</p>


<p></br>
After her death, Martha was quickly brought to the Cincinnati Ice Company, where she was held by her feet and frozen into a 300-pound block of ice. She was then sent by express train to the Smithsonian, where she arrived on September 4, 1914, and was photographed. She had been molting when she died, and as such she was missing a few feathers, including some of her longer tail feathers. William Palmer skinned Martha while Nelson R. Wood mounted her skin. Her internal parts were dissected by Robert Wilson Shufeldt and are also preserved and kept by the National Museum of Natural History.
</p>


<p>From the 1920s through the early 1950s she was displayed in the National Museum of Natural History's Bird Hall, placed on a small branch fastened to a block of Styrofoam and paired with a male passenger pigeon that had been shot in Minnesota in 1873. She was then displayed as part of the Birds of the World exhibit that ran from 1956 to 1999. During this time she left the Smithsonian twice—in 1966 to be displayed at the Zoological Society of San Diego's Golden Jubilee Conservation Conference, and in June 1974 to the Cincinnati Zoo for the dedication of the Passenger Pigeon Memorial. When the Smithsonian shut down its Birds of the World exhibit, Martha was removed from display and kept in a special exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo. Martha was back on display in the Smithsonian from June 2014 to September 2015 for the exhibit Once There Were Billions."
</p>


<p>We are in the midst of our home planet's sixth mass extinction ::: the shift from seemingless endless populations to the feasibly countable ::: finite ::: to the fragility of two to one to none
</p>


<p>a rapid trajectory to gone.
</p>


<p>The angel of history ::: the witness. Arduous population surveys ::: counts, maps, mathematical models, risk assessments ::: desperate attempts to hold on to last numbers ::: fragments ::: broken webs. Tattered systems ::: plastic torrents ::: carbon skies.
